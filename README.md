# Curse of dimensionality - Advanced Data Structures
Curse of dimensionality - Advanced Data Structures: We will see as we increase our dimensionality of the data, we will find out a sparsity issue.
Besides the points we take will be further than the center. Those are two of the reasons why it is called 'curse'.

However, in this work we are focus on how pointless could be the euclidean distance as we have more dimensions. Our points will be created randomly and we'll realize with charts ([Maldici√≥n de la dimensionalidad.pptx](https://github.com/alexjr2001/CurseOfDimensionality/blob/main/Maldici%C3%B3n%20de%20la%20dimensionalidad.pptx)) that our distance has nothing to do with previous distance calculations.
