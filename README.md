# Curse of dimensionality - Advanced Data Structures
Curse of dimensionality - Advanced Data Structures: We will see as we increase our dimensionality of the data, we will find out a sparsity issue.
Besides the points we take will be further than the center. Those are two of the reasons why it is called 'curse'.

However, in this work we are focus on how pointless could be the euclidean distance as we have more dimensions. Our points will be created randomly and we'll realize with charts ([Maldici√≥n de la dimensionalidad.pptx](https://github.com/alexjr2001/CurseOfDimensionality/blob/main/Maldici%C3%B3n%20de%20la%20dimensionalidad.pptx)) that our distance has nothing to do with previous distance calculations.

Example:

### ONE DIMENSION
In this first image, we see the results of the euclidean distance in two dimensions.

### FIFTY DIMENSIONS
In the second one, we'll see how the curse of dimensionality get involved with a dataset of 50 dimensions and also  make the sparsity issue clear.
